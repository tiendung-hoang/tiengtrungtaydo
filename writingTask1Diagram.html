      <h2>Framework for IELTS Writing Task 1: Man-Made Process</h2>
      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Purpose: Paraphrase the task prompt to introduce what the diagram shows and its purpose (what is being made or done). Step-by-Step Approach: Identify the Process: Note what is being produced or created (e.g., a car, a bottle, cement). Note the Nature: Confirm it’s a man-made process (e.g., industrial, mechanical, manual). Paraphrase: Use synonyms for "diagram" (e.g., illustration, figure) and "shows" (e.g., illustrates, depicts). Template: "The [diagram/illustration] [shows/illustrates] the process of [producing/manufacturing/creating] [product/output] through a series of [man-made/industrial] steps." Example: Scenario: A diagram of how plastic bottles are made. "The diagram illustrates the process of manufacturing plastic bottles through a series of industrial steps." Tips: Keep it concise (1 sentence, max 2). Avoid copying the task wording directly (e.g., change "shows" to "depicts").</p>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Purpose: Summarize the process by highlighting the number of steps, the starting point, and the end result, plus any notable features (e.g., linear, cyclical, multiple stages). Step-by-Step Approach: Count the Steps: Identify the total number of stages (e.g., 5 steps, 8 stages). Determine the Flow: Is it linear (start to finish) or cyclical (repeating)? Highlight Key Features: Note if it involves multiple phases (e.g., preparation, production), machinery, or recycling. Write: Use a general statement to capture the process’s essence. Template: "Overall, the process involves [number] stages, beginning with [starting point] and ending with [final product/output], following a [linear/cyclical] sequence [optional feature, e.g., ‘using specialized equipment’]." Example: Scenario: Plastic bottle manufacturing (5 steps: heating plastic, molding, cooling, trimming, packaging). "Overall, the process involves five stages, beginning with heating raw plastic and ending with packaged bottles, following a linear sequence using specialized machinery." Tips: Avoid specific details (save those for body paragraphs). Use "involves" or "consists of" for variety. Mention "linear" or "cyclical" if clear from the diagram.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 1: Early Stages:</strong> Purpose: Describe the initial steps of the process (usually the first half or up to a logical midpoint). Step-by-Step Approach: Divide the Process: Split the steps into two parts—cover the earlier ones here (e.g., preparation or raw material processing). Choose a Starting Point: Begin with the first step or a key initial action. Use Sequence Markers: Employ words like "initially," "first," "next" to show order. Focus on Actions: Use passive voice (e.g., "is heated") or active voice (e.g., "workers heat") depending on the diagram’s focus. Template: "The process begins with [first step], where [description of action]." "Next, [second step] [description]." "[Third step] is then [action], [additional detail]." (Optional) "Finally, in this phase, [last step of early stages] [description]."</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 2: Later Stages:</strong> Purpose: Describe the remaining steps (the second half or completion phase) leading to the final product. Step-by-Step Approach: Pick Up Where You Left Off: Start from the step after Body Paragraph 1 ends. Highlight Completion: Focus on finishing actions (e.g., assembly, packaging, quality checks). Use Dynamic Verbs: Emphasize transformation or finalization (e.g., "are assembled," "is completed"). End with the Outcome: Mention the final product or its readiness. Template: "Following [last step from Body 1], [next step] [description]." "Subsequently, [following step] is [action], [detail]." "The process concludes with [final step], resulting in [final product/output]." (Optional) "At this point, [additional detail, e.g., ‘the product is ready for distribution’]."</p>

      <h2>Essay 1: Water-Filter Assembly</h2>
      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The diagram illustrates the process of turning dirty water into clean drinking water through a series of man-made steps.</p>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Overall, the process involves six stages, beginning with the collection of dirty water and ending with the production of clean drinking water, following a linear sequence using a filtration system.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 1:</strong> The process begins with pouring dirty water into a plastic barrel, where it is collected through an open plastic lid. Initially, the water passes through layers of sand, charcoal, and gravel, which filter out impurities. This is then followed by the water moving downward into a storage drum located below the filtration system.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 2:</strong> Following the filtration, the clean water is stored in the drum until needed. Subsequently, the water is dispensed through a tap connected to the storage drum. The process concludes with the collection of drinking water in a cup, resulting in safe, filtered water ready for consumption.</p>

      <h2>Essay 2: Swing Basket and Rope Bucket</h2>
      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The diagrams depict two distinct methods of collecting water for irrigation purposes, namely the swing basket and the rope and bucket techniques.</p>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Overall, both methods involve manual or animal-assisted processes to lift water from a source, consisting of three main stages: water collection, lifting, and distribution to irrigation channels, with the swing basket relying on human effort and the rope and bucket utilizing animal power.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 1:</strong> The process begins with the swing basket method, where two individuals use a basket made of bamboo and leather, suspended by ropes, to collect water from a river. The basket is lowered approximately 1-2 metres into the water and swung upward by the coordinated pulling of the ropes. This is then followed by the water being directed to irrigation channels leading to the fields.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 2:</strong> In contrast, the rope and bucket method starts with a bucket lowered into a well 50 metres deep, guided by a pulley and rollers. Following this, a cow pulls the rope along a slope to lift the bucket, assisted by the mechanism. The process concludes with the water being channeled into irrigation systems, resulting in a more mechanized approach compared to the swing basket method.</p>

      <h2>Essay 3: Sea Water to Drinking Water</h2>
      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The diagram illustrates a simple device designed to convert sea water into drinking water through a natural process.</p>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Overall, the process involves six key stages, beginning with the exposure of sea water to sunlight and ending with the collection of drinking water, following a cyclical sequence that relies on evaporation and condensation.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 1:</strong> The process begins with sea water placed inside a container, where it is exposed to sunlight, causing evaporation as indicated by upward arrows. The heat from the sun warms the water, leading to vapor rising within the device. This is then followed by the vapor reaching the inner surface of a sloping cover.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 2:</strong> Subsequently, the vapor condenses on the cooler inner surface of the cover, forming droplets that slide down to a collection point. The process concludes with the collected drinking water being drawn out through a tube, resulting in purified water, which contrasts with the salty sea water input by removing impurities through evaporation.</p>

      <h2>Essay 4: Hydroelectric Dam and Wave-Air Generator</h2>
      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The diagrams illustrate two methods of generating electricity using water: the hydroelectric dam and the wave-air generator.</p>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Overall, both processes involve four main stages, starting with water collection and ending with electricity distribution, following a linear sequence, with the hydroelectric dam relying on stored water and the wave-air generator utilizing wave motion.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 1:</strong> The process begins with the hydroelectric dam, where water is stored in a reservoir and released through a gate. The water flows through a penstock, speeding up due to its width and angle, and turns the turbine and spindle to generate power. This is then followed by the electricity being distributed to power lines.</p>
      <p><strong>Body Paragraph 2:</strong> In contrast, the wave-air generator starts with waves entering the lower chamber, causing air to rise into the upper chamber. The air movement turns the spindle, which rotates to produce electric power via a generator. The process concludes with air being released from the upper chamber, resulting in a method that differs from the dam by harnessing wave energy rather than stored water.</p>
